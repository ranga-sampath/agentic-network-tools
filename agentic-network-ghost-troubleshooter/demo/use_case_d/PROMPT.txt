Our application stack on tf-dest-vm (10.0.1.5) is reporting dual service failures. PostgreSQL (port 5432) and Redis (port 6379) are both unreachable from tf-source-vm (10.0.1.4). The SRE team says this started after last week's NSG maintenance window where two engineers independently made changes. We need to know: is this a single infrastructure failure or two separate misconfigurations? Resource group: nw-forensics-rg.
