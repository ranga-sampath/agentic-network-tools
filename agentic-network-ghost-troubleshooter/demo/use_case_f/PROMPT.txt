Our data processing pipeline on tf-source-vm (10.0.1.4) cannot write to Azure Blob Storage. Jobs are failing with connection timeout errors to storage account nwlogs080613. The storage account appears healthy in the portal, the VM is running, and no NSG changes were made. This started after our platform team ran routine subnet maintenance this morning — they added an Azure SQL service endpoint to the default subnet in forensics-vnet. Investigate why Azure Storage is unreachable from the VM. Resource group: nw-forensics-rg.
