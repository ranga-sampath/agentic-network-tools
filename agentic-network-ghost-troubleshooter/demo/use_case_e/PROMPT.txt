tf-source-vm (10.0.1.4) has completely lost connectivity to tf-dest-vm (10.0.1.5). No NSG changes were made recently. Azure portal shows both VMs as healthy and running. Our first-level team already checked NSG rules and found everything is ALLOW — but connectivity is still broken. Please do a complete network path investigation and find where traffic is being lost.
